# cs5010_project
Data scraping and analysis project for CS 5010 - details to come.

## Project Scope


- Get dataset
    - [ ] Manual download for stats up till 2017
    - [ ] **Perhaps we can scrape data from 2018++
- Questions we can ask
    - [ ] “In CDC data they report “drug death”, but not the specific drug that caused the death” - we would like to gain a better understanding via machine learning, 
    - [ ] Cluster map on where the deaths are occurring state-by-state — draw conclusions based on current events on distribution -- https://blog.batchgeo.com/map-clustering-demo-tutorial/
- Looking at the data
    - [ ] Use classification or some sort of Machine Learning rather than “statistical techniques” to look at the specific drugs involved in drug poisoning fatalities related. https://www.nber.org/papers/w22504
      - i.e. this part: This analysis utilizes death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files to better measure the specific drugs involved in drug poisoning fatalities. Statistical adjustment procedures are used to provide more accurate estimates, accounting for the understatement in death certificate reports resulting because no drug is specified in between one-fifth and one-quarter of cases. The adjustment procedures typically raise the estimates of specific types of drug involvement by 30% to 50% and emphasize the importance of the simultaneous use of multiple categories of drugs
